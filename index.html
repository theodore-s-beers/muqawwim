          Calendrical problems can be notoriously difficult for historians to
          resolve. After all, a calendar is no better than the way in which it
          has been observed by particular institutions, or the scrupulousness
          with which dates are recorded in the source materials available to us.
          With this in mind, a conversion program based on the formal rules of
          the included calendars is unlikely to answer all questions. The idea
          is to provide accurate calculations assuming ideal circumstances.

          The Ottoman fiscal calendar, also known as the Rumi calendar,
          represented a way for the Ottoman government to set dates for various
          administrative processes—<em>e.g.</em>, collecting taxes and paying
          the army—that would remain in synchronization with the seasons. The
          value of this, as a complement to the lunar Islamic calendar, should
          be obvious. As early as 1740 CE, the Ottomans were using the Julian
          date of 1 March as the beginning of the fiscal year; and this system
          was developed further over time. There are a number of complications
          associated with this calendrical practice. The idea, at least
          initially, was for the numbering of years in the solar fiscal calendar
          to be kept in alignment with the Islamic calendar. This required
          <em>dropping</em> a year from the former every three decades.
          Eventually, as part of the

          reforms of 1839, it was decreed that the Julian calendar would be
          observed in a more systematic manner, in a variety of administrative
          contexts. From 1840 through early 1917 (when the policy was changed
          again), the Ottoman fiscal calendar followed relatively
          straightforward rules. The year began on 1 March, and the numbering
          reflected the Islamic, rather than the Christian era. The months had
          different names but otherwise tracked the Julian system. Converting
          from one to the other is simple. And so I have added support for this
          calendar, preliminarily, for the aforementioned period. The range may
          be expanded at some point. For a more detailed overview of the Ottoman
          fiscal calendar, see

          In the Hebrew calendar widget, the months are listed starting with
          Nisan, but each new year begins with Tishrei. This is simply a matter
          of convention. With regard to the Seleucid era, I have followed the
          method of subtracting 3,449 from
          <em>anno mundi</em>. That is, Seleucid year 1 opens with the month of
          Tishrei in 3450 AM, or September 312 BCE in the Julian calendar. If I
          have understood correctly, this was the prevalent way of reckoning the
          Seleucid era in Jewish contexts. See the

          (which dated back to 1079 CE but had not been used consistently in the
          intervening eras). Why would this recent standard be helpful for
          history before the twentieth century? The key point is that
          communities in Greater Iran have, since ancient times, treated the
          March equinox as the beginning of a new
          year&#8202;—&#8202;<em>i.e.</em>, the festival of

            >Nowruz</a
          >. This practice is formalized in the Solar Hijri calendar, with the
          first day of the year, 1 Farvardin, occurring at the March equinox as
          observed from central Iran (52.5 degrees east meridian). We can

          system, in which each year is associated with an animal sign in a
          repeating twelve-year cycle. The traditional Chinese calendar is
          lunisolar, and the year begins with a new moon that may occur between
          21 January and 20 February (Gregorian). Variants of this scheme have
          been followed, and in many cases continue to be used, in countries
          across Asia. During the Mongol period, the practice of classifying
          years with animals was brought to Iran, and, for a time, some authors
          of astronomical and historical works <em>in Persian</em> used the
          Chinese calendar directly as a way of dating events. The animal signs
          themselves became a lasting part of Persianate culture, except that
          there was (quite naturally) a shift toward setting the transition
          point between years at the March equinox. This convention took on
          importance in the historiography of the Timurid and Safavid
          periods&#8202;—&#8202;especially the latter. In several key Safavid
          Persian chronicles, insofar as an annalistic format is employed, each
          year-section begins at Nowruz and is labeled with the corresponding
          animal. (Months and days are given in the Islamic calendar only.) It
          is clear that authors of the time had some difficulty maintaining
          concordance between the solar and lunar schemes that they used; and
          this has occasionally led to confusion among modern historians. But
          that is a topic best left for another conversation. Returning to the
          matter of the Solar Hijri calendar, we have an accurate way of
          tracking the passage of solar years in Iran from one March equinox to
          the next, and so we need only a bit of modular arithmetic to calculate
          the animal sign associated with any date.

          It may go without saying, but users of this program should exercise
          care when interpreting results, in proportion to the degree of
          precision that is required, and with particular sensitivity to
          breakpoints. If, for example, you were studying an event in Safavid
          history that took place within a few days of the March equinox, it
          could be difficult to determine which animal year was in effect, since
          the actual observance of Nowruz varied slightly based on a number of
          factors. But I hope you will find, as I have, that formally correct
          conversion of dates is more than adequate in almost all cases.
